    <p class="def">Aari work is a type of embroidery which is done on a stretched fabric and stitching the design with a long needle which has a hook in the end. The needle technique origins from the mocha community who use this type of needle to stitch intricate patterns on leather footwear. The needle is named as Aari, from which the embroidery work derives its name as Aari work. This work consists of beads, stones, golden and silver threads which gives a royal richness to the design. Aari work is known for its elegant thread work that enhances the gravity of hand embroidery.</p>
